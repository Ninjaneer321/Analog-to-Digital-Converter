# Design of a 4-bit Counter Type/Ramp Type Analog to Digital converter (ADC)
This repository presents the mixed signal design of a Counter Type/Ramp Type ADC. The Digital part of the circuit i.e 4- bit counter is simulated on Makerchip tool. All the Simulations are done using Esim and Makerchip tool only. Since the counter used is taken to be 4-Bit, the input voltage that can be converted to analog is limited to 0-15V. A 4-Bit Digital to Analog Converter (DAC) is used as an internal part, having the step size of 1V.
